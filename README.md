## Description

In this project I am refactoring a website to make it more user friendly and accessible. By refactoring the website I created a more accesible experience for more users.

## Installation
In order to make the website more accessible, I went through and added alt tags to all the images, added semantic HTML elements, and condenced the CSS code.

## Usage
